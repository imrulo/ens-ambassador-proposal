## Project Name
ENS Ambassador for the Spanish-Speaking Community

## How does this benefit ENS?
This project will strengthen the ENS ecosystem by:
- **Increasing Adoption:** Expanding awareness and registration of ENS domains among Spanish-speaking communities, a significant and growing demographic.
- **Promoting Open Standards:** Educating users on the advantages of ENS’s decentralized, community-governed model compared to closed solutions like Unstoppable Domains.
- **Enhancing Inclusivity:** Providing accessible, high-quality educational resources in Spanish to bridge the language gap in Web3.
- **Advancing Digital Sovereignty:** Aligning with ENS’s values by promoting ethical, user-empowered practices in Web3.

## Project Overview
The "ENS Ambassador for the Spanish-Speaking Community" is a three-month pilot project designed to educate and engage Spanish-speaking audiences about the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and the Ethereum ecosystem. As an ambassador, I will focus on three core objectives:
1. **Education on Open Standards:** Develop and distribute Spanish-language content, including articles, videos, and infographics, to explain ENS’s benefits and functionalities.
2. **Countering Misinformation:** Create materials that clarify misconceptions about domain name services, emphasizing ENS’s decentralized nature over closed alternatives.
3. **Promoting Digital Sovereignty:** Host workshops and webinars to teach users how ENS empowers them to control their digital identities without centralized intermediaries.

### Key Activities and Milestones
- **Months 1-2:** Produce and publish at least 10 articles and 5 videos covering ENS basics, advanced features, and comparisons with other domain services.
- **Month 3:** Organize two online workshops with live Q&A sessions to engage directly with the community and address their questions.
- **Ongoing:** Maintain an active presence on X ([@guinoki_eth](https://x.com/guinoki_eth)), posting regular updates, tips, and educational snippets to foster continuous engagement.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Increased Adoption:** Measurable increase in ENS domain registrations from Spanish-speaking regions, tracked via ENS analytics.
- **Community Engagement:** Growth in followers and engagement rates on social media channels, particularly X.
- **Educational Impact:** Positive feedback and high participation in workshops, with at least 50 attendees across the two sessions.
- **Resource Creation:** Establishment of a repository of reusable Spanish-language educational materials, hosted on a dedicated platform.

### Budget Request
I am requesting a $6,000 grant for the three-month pilot phase, allocated as follows:

**Budget Justification:**
- **Video Creation Software ($1,020):** A subscription to a high-quality video creation tool (300 EUR/month, approximately $340/month at 1.13 USD/EUR) ensures professional-grade videos to engage the audience effectively.
- **AI Content Tools ($300):** Tools like Jasper or Copy.ai ($100/month) will streamline content creation, ensuring consistent and high-quality educational materials.
- **Hosting Fees ($60):** Basic hosting ($20/month) will support a website or platform to distribute content, ensuring accessibility.

The budget reflects a balance between high-quality tools and fair compensation, ensuring the project’s success while maintaining transparency.

### Future Plans
Upon successful completion of the pilot phase, I will deliver KPIs, including domain registration data, workshop attendance, and social media metrics. Based on these results, I plan to apply for a second $6,000 grant to expand the project, potentially including in-person events, collaborations with Web3 communities, and translation of official ENS documentation.

## Additional Info
This project draws inspiration from successful ENS DAO-funded initiatives like SheFi, which educated over 9,000 individuals on Web3 ([ENS Public Goods Grants](https://builder.ensgrants.xyz/)). My experience in content creations equips me to deliver impactful results. The project will leverage existing Spanish-speaking Web3 communities and platforms like X to maximize reach. I am prepared to present this proposal at the ENS Ecosystem Working Group’s weekly meeting ([Weekly Meeting](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-ecosystem-weekly-meeting-11am-et-thursday-term-6/20061)).
